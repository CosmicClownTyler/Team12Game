## Gorodki Rules and Terminology

Gorodki is a Russian folk sport dating back to the 17th century and plays somewhat similarly to modern bowling. The goal is to knock a group of pins, called *gorodki*, out of the playing area, called the *gorod*. The sport is played with opponents taking turns to knock their gorodki out of the gorod in as few throws as possible.
