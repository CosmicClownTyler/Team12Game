# Prefabs Explanation

The prefabs created for this game use consistent terminology to reference things that are called something else in the actual gameplay. A list of these can be found below. 

Bats are always called bats and refer to the object that the player throws. 

Pins and the groups they are in are referred to as 'gorodki' in-game. 

The area where the pins are placed is referred to as the game area in the assets. This area is broken down into two sub-areas, the city area and the suburb area. Both of these are collectively referred to as the 'gorod' in-game.
